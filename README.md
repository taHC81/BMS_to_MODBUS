Software part for UART BMS (JBD, JK) to addressable RS485 Modbus protocol.

## Overview
Common JK or JBD BMS often offers RS485 port, which is just a different physical layer for proprietary protocol running on UART port, not a [Modbus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modbus). Because of this, you can't simply connect multiple BMS to a RS485 network.
